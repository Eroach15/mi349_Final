            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I am a senior at Michigan State University, pursuing a degree in Games & Interactive media and a minor in entrepreneurship.
                I have always had a great passion for video games and the relationships, connections, and emotions that are formed from being a part of the community. I hope that one day I can utilize my creative, artistic, and communication skills to create games that leave a lasting impact on those who play. With this goal in mind, I hope to create a community for all.
            </p>

            <p>I hope to further devlop this page as a way to archive my projects to showcase my work, create an archive of techniques and methods used, and show others a step by step guide on how to create similar projects!</p>
