        First Post! (11/1/23)

        <p>Welcome to my blog page. In this blog I will be talking about my favorite game Brawl Stars. Brawl Stars is a mobile only game that was created by the popular studio SuperCell. Brawl Stars lets you choose one of over seventy characters to take into a 10 person free for all, or a 3v3 game. 3v3 games include gem grab, brawl ball, heist, payload, and seige. Brawl stars may seem like a silly mobile game but it is rich with detailed game systems, awesome characters, cool cosmetics, and great fun!</p>

        <p>I recommend brawl stars to anyone who hasn't given it a shot yet or hasn't played it in a long time. There are so many characters to try out and they
            all have their own abilities and synnergies. Everytime I pick up the game I get to play a new match-up and learn more about the character I chose to
        play.</p>

        <p>One thing I really admire about SuperCell is that they have made all the paid cosmetics available to unlock by collecting a free-to-play currency
            called bling. Nothing in the game is behind a paywall and you can be free-to-play if you want which I think is a great thing.</p>
